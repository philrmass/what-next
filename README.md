# What Next
### By Phil Mass

A calendar-replacement progressive web app (PWA) with notes and upcoming events. You can see all of your upcoming events at a glance without needing to look a specific month or day. The notes allow you to create single text notes or checklists. All of your data is stored in local storage and can be saved and reloaded.

You can find the deployed version at [https://philrmass.github.io/what-next/](https://philrmass.github.io/what-next/). If you open it up on mobile, you should be given the option to install it and then use it like an app (only tested on Android).
